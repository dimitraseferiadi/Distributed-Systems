and now i need to copy a directory from my local machine to my vm1. how to do that?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
To copy a directory from your local machine to your VM1 through the bastion host, you can use the scp (secure copy) command with the -o option to specify the bastion host as a proxy. Since you've set up the SSH configuration in the script, you can use the SSH aliases defined in the ~/.ssh/config file.

Here's how you can copy a directory to vm1:

Syntax:

bash
Αντιγραφή
Επεξεργασία
scp -r -o ProxyJump=${TEAM_NAME}-bastion /path/to/local/directory ${TEAM_NAME}-vm1:/path/to/destination
Example: Assuming you want to copy a local directory named my_project to vm1 in the directory /home/ubuntu/, you would run:

bash
Αντιγραφή
Επεξεργασία
scp -r -o ProxyJump=${TEAM_NAME}-bastion my_project ${TEAM_NAME}-vm1:/home/ubuntu/
In this command:

-r tells scp to copy the entire directory (recursively).
-o ProxyJump=${TEAM_NAME}-bastion uses the bastion host as the jump host.
my_project is the local directory you're copying.
${TEAM_NAME}-vm1 is the alias for your VM1 (configured in your SSH config).
/home/ubuntu/ is the destination path on VM1 where you want to copy the directory.
This command will securely copy the entire my_project directory from your local machine to the VM1 through the bastion host.

Let me know if you need further clarification!

Είπες:
what should i run on my terminal?
Το ChatGPT είπε:
To copy a directory from your local machine to VM1 through the bastion host, you should run the following command in your terminal:

Open your terminal.

Use the following scp command (replace my_project with the name of the directory you want to copy and adjust the destination path as needed):

bash
Αντιγραφή
Επεξεργασία
scp -r -o ProxyJump=${TEAM_NAME}-bastion /path/to/local/directory ${TEAM_NAME}-vm1:/home/ubuntu/
Steps:
Replace /path/to/local/directory with the actual path to the directory you want to copy on your local machine (for example, ./my_project if it's in your current directory).
Replace ${TEAM_NAME} with your actual team name (the name of the folder you're in).
If you're copying to a different path on VM1, change /home/ubuntu/ to the desired path.
Example:
Assuming:

The directory you want to copy is named my_project.
Your team name is team_X.
You want to copy the directory to /home/ubuntu/ on VM1.
The command would look like this:

bash
Αντιγραφή
Επεξεργασία
scp -r -o ProxyJump=team_X-bastion my_project team_X-vm1:/home/ubuntu/
Explanation:
scp -r is used to copy a directory recursively.
-o ProxyJump=team_X-bastion tells scp to use the bastion host as a proxy to connect to the VM.
my_project is the directory you're copying.
team_X-vm1 is the alias for your VM1 (configured in your SSH config).
/home/ubuntu/ is the destination directory on VM1 where you want to copy the directory.
Once you run this command, you will be prompted to enter the password or passphrase (if necessary) for the SSH key, and the directory will be copied over.

Let me know if you encounter any issues!



COPY TO THE OTHER VMS:
scp -F ~/.ssh/config -r /home/areti/Desktop/distributed_systems team_29-vm5:/home/ubuntu/

anoikse k trekse nodes sta nodes!!!
ssh -t team_29-vm4 'python3 /home/ubuntu/distributed_systems/server/node.py 10.0.36.43 5007 3 10.0.36.56 5000; exec bash'
